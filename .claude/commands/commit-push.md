description: Stage, commit, and push local changes with a conventional commit message. Run docs-agent first if documentation needs updating.

## Commit and Push

### Pre-flight — Documentation Update (REQUIRED)

1. **Review changes first**
   - Run `git status` and `git diff --stat` to see what's changed.

2. **Run docs-agent** — This is NOT optional. Before committing, you MUST launch the `docs-agent` subagent to update CHANGELOG.md and README.md if this commit includes feature, fix, or breaking changes. Wait for it to complete before proceeding to commit.
   - Skip docs-agent ONLY if the changes are purely chore/refactor with no user-facing impact (e.g., renaming internal variables, updating comments).

### Tasks

1. **Stage commit and push ALL local changes**
   - Summarize the changes for the commit message.

2. **Stage files**
   - Stage relevant files by name (avoid `git add -A` to prevent accidental includes).
   - Never stage `.env`, credentials, or secrets.

3. **Commit with conventional format**
   ```
   feat(client): add double jump mechanic
   chore(ci): update GameCI action version
   docs: update API contracts for /api/me endpoint
   ```
   - Scope: `client`, `server`, `ci`, `docs`, or omit for cross-cutting changes.
   - Keep the subject line under 72 characters.
   - Add a body paragraph if the change needs explanation.

4. **Push to origin**
   - Push to the current branch: `git push -u origin HEAD`
   - If on `main`/`master`, warn the user and suggest creating a feature branch first.

### Final result
- All local changes committed and pushed to the correct origin branch with a clear conventional commit message.
